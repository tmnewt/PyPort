# Python Finance Portfolio Research (currently undergoing an overhaul)

## I honestly can't remember what I was doing with this. Jeez, my old code sucks!

Wow I just went through the mini-program.... This feels like it wasn't written by me. Ew... this all sucks. Where do I even begin?

Well, I honestly wasn't expecting this level of incompetency from my old self but it looks like he tried his hardest. How cute. Looking at my private notes I guess I was trying to modularize each individual component so that it would be easier to manage and would scale effectively. I'm just going to start with the fundamentals and look into how gathering the data can be perfected. I've heard that the pandas_datareader still suffers from *cough* inconsistencies *cough*. Only one way to find out.
